# 2D Terrain by Midpoint Displacement in SWIFT

I was looking at different methods for generating 2D terrain and came accross this article by Loktar:

Simple 2d Terrain With Midpoint Displacement
http://www.somethinghitme.com/2013/11/11/simple-2d-terrain-with-midpoint-displacement/

I rewrote the JavaScript sample from the article in SWIFT (which was suprisingly easy). While there are other methods for 2D terrain generation, I thought this was a very nice implementation of midpoint displacement.

SWIFT 2.x Xcode 7.x

## What Does this Do?

The app generates terrain and uses the path to create an SKShapeNode. Click on the screen to generate a new node.
