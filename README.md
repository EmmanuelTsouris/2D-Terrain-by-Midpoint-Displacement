# 2D Terrain by Midpoint Displacement

I was looking at different methods for generating 2D terrain and came accross this article by Loktar:

Simple 2d Terrain With Midpoint Displacement
http://www.somethinghitme.com/2013/11/11/simple-2d-terrain-with-midpoint-displacement/

So I rewrote the JavaScript in SWIFT (which was suprisingly easy). While there are other methods for 2D terrain generation, I thought this was a very nice implementation of midpoint displacement.
